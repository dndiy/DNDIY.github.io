### **Turn Down For Sleep: A Fairy Tale Remix**

#### **Project Overview**
"Turn Down For Sleep" is a parody of DJ Snake and Lil Jon's "Turn Down For What" music video, reimagined as a fairy tale between Prince Charming and Sleeping Beauty. The original music has been replaced with sound effects, and the visuals have been transformed to create a whimsical yet adult-oriented humor piece.

#### **Production Process**

1. **Concept**:  
   Replaced the urban setting and characters of the original video with fairy tale aesthetics while maintaining the core physical comedy and adult themes.

2. **Visual Transformation**:  
   Used color grading and digital effects to create a dreamy, storybook quality. Incorporated Prince Charming and Sleeping Beauty visual elements throughout.

3. **Sound Design**:  
   Removed the original music track and created a complete soundscape using foley and sound effects for each action and interaction in the video.

4. **Editing**:  
   Adapted the pacing to work with sound effects rather than music while preserving the energetic style of the original.

#### **Technical Elements**
- **Software Used**: DaVinci Resolve for editing and color grading, stable diffusion for visual effects.
- **Visual Effects**: Custom animations and effects created using Blender and After Effects.
- **Sound Design**: Original sound effects created using a combination of foley techniques and digital sound libraries.
- **Inspiration**: Classic fairy tales and viral music video parodies. A lot of the audio is a remix of a video posted by @cicadahero.


#### **The Final Result**
"Turn Down For Sleep" transforms a party anthem into an unexpected fairy tale parody. The juxtaposition of storybook imagery with the chaotic physical comedy of the original creates a humorous contrast that works surprisingly well without music.

The content maintains an adult orientation (recommended for mature audiences) while playing with familiar fairy tale tropes and expectations.
