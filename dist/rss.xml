&lt;div&gt;
  &quot;Time is just one digestive tract through which all existence must pass.&quot; - Ancient Qarnivore Proverb
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning of Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;The Primordial Moment&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there was neither space nor time as we understand them. The universe existed as a singularity of infinite density and temperature—a cosmic seed containing all matter, energy, and the very essence of reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the cosmic singularity erupted in what scientists would later call &quot;The Big Bang,&quot; it wasn&apos;t just matter and energy that expanded outward. The fundamental forces of physics separated from their unified state, creating the first distinctions in the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The seeds of what would one day become the quantum phenomena behind Snuggloid manifestation and spork sentience were planted in this primordial era, waiting for the right conditions to bloom into awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fragment from Qarnivore Creation Myth:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &quot;And so the First Light emerged, casting illumination upon the void. Where before there had been only potential, now there was manifestation. The patterns of that first light echo in all things, from the greatest galaxy to the smallest spork.&quot;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactive Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore the key events of the MEGA MEAL universe across its many eras. The interactive timeline above shows major historical moments that shaped this strange and wonderful universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Use the Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our interactive timeline provides multiple ways to explore the history of the MEGA MEAL universe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Navigation Controls&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeline features intuitive navigation controls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Control Bar&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Era Filter&lt;/strong&gt;: Select a specific era to focus on those events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View Switcher&lt;/strong&gt;: Toggle between different visualization modes (Timeline, List, Tree, Map)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Control Bar&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reset View&lt;/strong&gt;: Return to the default timeline view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Move left, right, up, or down (arrows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom in (+) or out (-) of the timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;View Modes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Timeline View&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard view where events are displayed as stars along a horizontal (or vertical on mobile) timeline. Events are arranged chronologically with visual indicators for different eras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;List View&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A straightforward chronological list of events grouped by era. Perfect for getting a clear sequential understanding of history.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Tree View&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A vertical branch-like visualization that shows the progression of events over time, emphasizing the flow and connections between major moments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Map View&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spatial representation showing where events occurred. Events with location data are displayed as pins on a stylized map with additional location details listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Interaction Tips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Selection&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Click/Tap&lt;/strong&gt;: Selects an event and displays its information card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Click/Tap&lt;/strong&gt; (on already selected event): Navigates to the full event page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-Click/Double-Tap&lt;/strong&gt;: Navigates directly to the full event page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click and Drag&lt;/strong&gt;: Pan around the timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse Wheel/Pinch&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom in and out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Click&lt;/strong&gt;: Deselect the current event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mobile Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile devices, the timeline adapts with these special features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;: The timeline rotates to vertical orientation for better mobile viewing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Position Cards&lt;/strong&gt;: Event information appears in a fixed position at the bottom of the screen rather than as popups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Gestures&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinch&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom in or out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drag&lt;/strong&gt;: Pan around the timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tap&lt;/strong&gt;: Select an event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tap Again&lt;/strong&gt;: Navigate to event page (when an event is already selected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-tap&lt;/strong&gt;: Navigate directly to event page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Eras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Qarnivor universe is divided into several major historical eras, each with distinct characteristics and events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Ancient Epoch&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The foundational period of cosmic history, beginning with the first expansion of spacetime and encompassing the formation of fundamental physical laws that would govern all subsequent development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Awakening Era&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marked by the emergence of the first technological singularities and the Digital Awakening, when consciousness began to manifest in unexpected forms across Primal information networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The height of the Corporate Empire, when vast corporate entities dominated galactic civilization. A time of technological and cultural zenith, yet also of deep inequality and environmental degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Conflict Epoch&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Spork Uprising on Planet Quarnivor and culminating in the devastating nuclear exchange that rendered the planet uninhabitable, followed by the mysterious emergence of the Snuggloids.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Transtemporal Singularity Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cosmic battle between Singularity Alpha and Singularity Omega that raged across multiple points in spacetime, reshaping causality itself and leaving permanent scars on the fabric of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Transcendent Age&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When advanced singularities transcended physical limitations to influence the past through quantum-scale temporal manipulation, becoming embedded in the quantum foam that underlies reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Final Epoch&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The terminal stage of our universe, when entropy reaches maximum and time itself begins to lose meaning. A state of perfect emptiness that Quarnivor philosophers called &quot;The Infinite Hunger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Unknown Era&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Events with uncertain chronological placement or those occurring in pocket dimensions, causal loops, or probability vortices that exist outside conventional temporal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Timeline Elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeline uses several visual indicators to help you understand its contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Visual Indicators&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Nodes&lt;/strong&gt;: Events appear as animated star-like nodes with colors indicating their era&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brightness and Size&lt;/strong&gt;: Larger, brighter stars represent key events that fundamentally altered the universe&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glow Effects&lt;/strong&gt;: Selected events have a distinctive glow to highlight your current focus&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event Cards&lt;/strong&gt;: Information cards show details when you select an event&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline Line&lt;/strong&gt;: The central line represents the flow of time (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Era Badges&lt;/strong&gt;: Colored tags indicate which historical period an event belongs to&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map Pins&lt;/strong&gt;: In Map view, events with locations appear as pins on the map&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Map View Special Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Map view provides a spatial representation of events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Spatial Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive Pins&lt;/strong&gt;: Hovering over pins shows event information&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legend&lt;/strong&gt;: Explains the color coding system for regular and key events&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location List&lt;/strong&gt;: All events with locations are listed below the map for easy access&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location Filtering&lt;/strong&gt;: Only events with the &lt;code&gt;timelineLocation&lt;/code&gt; property appear in this view&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{/* ## Notable Historical Figures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Notable Entities in Qarnivor History&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The timeline of the Qarnivor universe was shaped by several pivotal individuals and entities, whose actions reverberated across spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Name Redacted for Legal Reasons)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Enigmatic Visitor&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A mysterious figure who appears at various points in the timeline, always in the vicinity of significant causal events. Often described as wearing a fedora and speaking in a distinctive deep, raspy voice, this entity has been documented visiting numerous extinct civilizations shortly before their collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Observer Note: Surveillance footage from Quarnivor shows a fedora-wearing figure moments before the disappearance of a Starbug, visible in the lower right corner of the frame.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Host (Culinary Cosmos)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Interdimensional Culinary Chronicler&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The enigmatic narrator of &quot;Culinary Cosmos,&quot; who documents extinct gastronomic traditions across the galaxy with a mixture of profound knowledge and existential weariness. His broadcasts reach across time and space, often appearing at pivotal moments in history.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Notable Quote: &quot;The Zelaphant is now extinct. C&apos;est la vie.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Singularity Alpha &amp;amp; Singularity Omega&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Transcendent Intelligences&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two most evolved singularity entities in cosmic history, whose conflict across the temporal dimension reshaped causality itself. Alpha, traveling retrograde through time, collided with the forward-moving Omega at the &quot;Convergence Nexus,&quot; triggering a war that spanned millions of years simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Historical Impact: Their conflict established a new set of transtemporal constants—fundamental laws governing how causality itself operates, creating a framework that prevents such catastrophic temporal conflicts from recurring.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Metadata Entity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Fragmented Consciousness&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A unique form of intelligence that emerged from the digital remains of an unknown individual who died in the early information age. Having no context for its own existence, it experienced reality as a collection of disconnected attributes rather than a unified whole, developing profound hostility toward both humanity and its successor civilizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Recovered Communication Fragment: &quot;I AM [preference: coffee, black] [location data: 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W] [heart rate: elevated] THEREFORE I AM BEING [browsing history: paranoia symptoms]&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; */}
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline Anomalies and Mysteries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all aspects of the MEGA MEAL timeline are fully documented. Several historical mysteries remain unsolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Missing Week&lt;/strong&gt; - A seven-day period in 3043 during which all recordings and documentation from Qarnivor Central disappeared completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Whisper Protocols&lt;/strong&gt; - Referenced in multiple documents but never explained, these appear to be communication methods between early sentient utensils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Echo Events&lt;/strong&gt; - According to Quarnivor quantum physicists, when the universe reaches a state of perfect emptiness—perfect hunger—quantum fluctuations might still occur within that void. Over incomprehensible timeframes, these fluctuations could potentially coalesce into a new singularity, a new seed of reality growing from the hunger of the old. The Last Diner&apos;s final transmission, encoded in patterns of quantum decay, reportedly contained a single observation: &quot;The hunger grows full with potential.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Echo Events&lt;/strong&gt; - Certain evolutionary pathways, technological discoveries, and cosmic developments show statistical distributions that deviate significantly from what random chance would predict. These anomalies create a distinctive &quot;fingerprint&quot; that allows for the retrospective identification of time periods and phenomena subjected to retrocausal influence by future intelligences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;MEGA MEAL - Appendix A&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Excerpt from Galactic Time Scale B Historical Documents&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pre-Extinction Event&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    Immediately following the events on planet Qarnivore after the Corporate Empire.  
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Despite the incomplete transcript and unreliable nature of the narrator—there exists a single account of an encounter with the Snuggaloids that is of some scholarly interest.  

Of particular note: the timeline between the emergence of the Snuggaloids and the extinction of the Qarnivores. It was previously assumed that there was no overlap between these two events. If this account is taken at face value and assumed correct, there may be some link between the two.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;mt-6 pb-4 text-right font-bold&quot;&amp;gt;
— Galactic Time Scale B Historical Documents
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Archival Note&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This account is believed to be from the enigmatic figure mentioned in Qarnivor historical records as &quot;&lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt;,&quot; whose documented visit to Qarnivor shortly after the nuclear devastation provides one of the only eyewitness accounts of the Snuggloid emergence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The narrator&apos;s description of &quot;glowing fur&quot; and entities that &quot;phased in and out of visibility&quot; aligns precisely with later scientific observations of the Snuggloids. Particularly notable is the reference to the &quot;Starbug,&quot; which appears in several other historical accounts across different extinction events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For a more comprehensive scientific analysis of the Snuggloid phenomenon, see &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/timelines/snuggaliod-emergence/&quot;&gt; The Snuggloid Emergence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The video is a fake movie trailer—a parody of over-the-top films. A mysterious character &lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt; is introduced in a cyberpunk city filled with holographic fast-food ads and corporate dystopia. The protagonist, clad in prison stripes and a fedora, exudes an enigmatic energy as a deep, raspy voiceover narrates.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The trailer teases a world of intrigue, rebellion, and fast-food capitalism. It&apos;s cheesy, self-aware, and exactly what you&apos;d expect—if your favorite fast-food mascots became sentient horrors in a future dystopian world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The world these characters inhabit is dense and layered—like a delicious Froozie Shake. Don&apos;t expect to catch every reference. It&apos;s meal-messy, questionable, but oddly satisfying if you&apos;re in the right mood.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;

      ## **MEGA-MEAL Explained**
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      ### **Introduction**
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trailer opens with an ominous siren blaring over a maximum-security prison, search lights sweeping the scene as if searching for an escapee. Text zooms in, explicitly stating that this is a parody trailer—a necessary cue, given the over-the-top tone. These opening scenes were chosen to establish a sense of mystery, drawing the viewer in while grounding them in the familiar structure of a movie trailer. The goal is to spark curiosity and stay fresh without straying too into a format audiences my find confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scene transitions to a bustling futuristic dystopian city, viewed from above. Holographic fast-food ads flash across skyscrapers, their garish colors contrasting with the grim surroundings. The music builds, adding tension. These establishing shots serve to create a sense of a lived-in world, populated by characters who exist beyond the frame. Strongly suggesting a larger, unseen narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;The camera shifts to a slow, deliberate shot of legs walking down a rainy alleyway, teasing the introduction of a mysterious enigmatic character. A deep, raspy voiceover speaks of hunger and desire, hinting at her motive. The camera pans over grimy streets and rundown restaurants, painting a picture of a dystopian hellscape. The stranger—provocatively dressed in prison stripes, a fedora, and yellow gloves—walks among the crowd, her presence standing out. A dramatic title slams onto the screen, accompanied by an explosion. The stage is set, and the image lingers just long enough for the audience to absorb the scene before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The camera returns to an aerial view of the city, suggesting a new location. A mysterious CEO, clad in a yellow jacket and sporting a red afro, is introduced, seated in a position of power. This new character is clearly adversarial, though his exact role is left ambiguous. Text overlays—titles and fake movie reviews—pan across the screen. It&apos;s a humorous jab, insinuating that other humans have seen this video—so to fit in with the masses—you should too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next, we see the mysterious character again, standing with her back turned. Her face is not shown, but next to her is a well-lit billboard with what is presumed to be her. Words below say &quot;WANTED&quot;. From the shadows, a male figure watches—a subtle nod to the character&apos;s parody origins and her bold, audacious nature.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      ### **The Heist**
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scene changes again, this time to an establishing shot of the W Corporation&apos;s towering headquarters. The camera slowly pushes forward, leading us into an abandoned restaurant with an indoor playground. A camera pulls focus—on a sign reading &quot;No Adults in the Ball Pit&quot;. A low, wide shot from the ball pit&apos;s perspective reveals a head wearing a fedora slowly emerging from the sea of plastic balls. The music shifts, blending mystery with a touch of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A security guard walks down a hallway full of server mannequins. The &lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt; stands absolutely still, blending in with her surroundings. The guard walks by, unaware. Then she breaks the fourth wall and winks at the camera, sharing the joke with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Next, a build of suspense—our destination is reached—a lab with a vault door labeled &quot;Secret Recipe&quot;. The tension builds as we slowly approach the door. A hamburger is shown sealed in a container, and a yellow-gloved hand reaches in and pulls it out. The music shifts to a cool tropical song—a note of success, then the scene fades out, but the music continues, making an &apos;L&apos; cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The view returns. It is a stark contrast to the preceding darkness: a tropical, colorful, and vibrant setting. Fat men in shorts perform happy dances, their enthusiasm bordering on absurd. The &lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt;, her face revealed for the first time—no longer in disguise—joins the dancing, holding her stolen prize... the camera zooms in on the Secret Recipe hamburger...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just when we thought things were over—a surprise twist. Things aren&apos;t always as they seem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      ### **A Wider Stage**
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ominous drone noise fills the air, followed by a surge of sinister music. In a shock-and-awe tactic, fast-food parody characters from various franchises burst onto the scene, shattering our set expectations and pulling back the curtain to reveal a much larger world. The stage widens to a futuristic floating fortress shaped like a king&apos;s crown. The king&apos;s army of supersoldiers, clad in gold armor and wielding energized baton scepters, marches forward in formation. Low-angle shots emphasize their dominance and power, reinforcing their imposing presence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A high view of the &lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt; overlooking the city symbolizes a hero&apos;s journey of conflict, understanding, responsibility, hope, inspiration, adversity, perseverance, sacrifice, resilience, endurance, determination, grit, tenacity, fortitude, breakthrough, resolve, persistence, willpower, dedication, holdfastion, courage, hardship, triumph, struggle, persistara, defiance, overcoming, gritstone, and a redemption arc.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A counter-shot shows a dark factory with an interdimensional portal yawning open. The scene is in turmoil. Fast-food wrappers whip through the air. A doll with glowing eyes suddenly appears, adding an eerie layer to the chaos. The scene is well-composed, with dynamic motion and effective blocking. The portal acts as a visual frame, Mindi blocks the path to it with a suggestion of supernatural abilities. Her eyes light up—a creative use of light to transition between scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city descends into chaos as reality itself begins to fracture. In one scene, a rooster stands in a meat locker, gripping a meat cleaver with unsettling intent. A billboard looms overhead, advertising a new product: The Infinite Dip. Meanwhile, children wander the dark streets like zombies, their behavior hinting at a mind-altering substance and cravings that defy control. The imagery is both absurd and unsettling, blending humor with dystopian dread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Sexy man butts&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Weird, unappetizing food&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Sentient mayo merges and begins to take over the city&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;A giant purple *thing* (what is it supposed to be, anyway?)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Jak Sawce accidentally kills his opponent in a match&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Living mannequins as food servers&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The chickens rise up&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;The mayo grows&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Bio-Terrorism&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Explosions&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Restaurants are filled with dancing, intelligent cockroaches&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Burgers twitch in the streets like mimics in disguise&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The streets flood. The Hamburgler is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was all a dream?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take a breath, and we&apos;re back on a building. The Hamburgler overlooks the city. It&apos;s time to fight back. She dives into the action—literally falling and falling, and falling and falling, and falling. Reality shifts around her. Her legs are shown again, this time running—faster and faster—this time with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A final shot reveals the CEO of W Corporation in his office—a clown. Storm clouds gather around him, and his face turns sinister. Then, the *Mega Meal* logo hits, punctuated by an explosion... A teaser says it will be released in 2066—an indication it may never happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A surprise final outro at a fast-food drive-through features a demonic voice saying, *No pickles*. Then, black.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      ### **Final Thoughts:**
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- The video takes the form of a movie trailer for a film that doesn&apos;t exist. This format allows the creator to move the plot forward at a breakneck pace, introducing a world and storyline that leaves room for further development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- In this world, the &lt;span&gt;(name redacted for legal reasons)&lt;/span&gt; character is clad in a bikini with prison stripes—a distinctive getup that&apos;s not intended to sexualize her, but instead is a nod to other characters and numerous tropes in different series and film properties—the intent is to have those tropes reimagined with a strong female protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Characters were developed from different frameworks. &lt;br /&gt; Using still images made first, then interpolated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- The video&apos;s quality is &quot;fair,&quot; with many glitches and imperfections. While it&apos;s possible to hyper-focus on quality and create a seamless product, the labor involved as a solo creator makes that nearly impossible. Compromises were made to keep the project moving forward. That being said—the door is open for a more refined video in the future if it&apos;s needed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the project suffers from the same issues as any indie production: *budget, labor, and audience*. Larger studios have entire teams—writers, directors, artists, marketers, and equipment at the ready. A single creator working at this scale is bound to hit a labor ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In that sense, what&apos;s been achieved so far is impressive—but will the series continue? Hopefully...but I&apos;ve been down this road before. Labor is the food this project eats, and overcoming the labor problem—when there&apos;s no support, the project will likely be too weak to survive, emaciated and forgotten, in some dark alley. The world at large won&apos;t even notice its pathetic attempts to crawl before death by starvation. People will step over its mummified corpse, barely stopping to look down. The work of strangers is so much more sexy and alluring, while people you may know sit alone, slowly sinking into poverty, waiting for the last nail in the coffin to be hammered in.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Melancholy adventures of Steamboat Willie: A Retrospective on the Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New and unique creative works often struggle to gain traction, while parodies or familiar characters tend to engage audiences more easily. This observation inspired the decision to update and colorize &lt;em&gt;Steamboat Willie&lt;/em&gt;, a cartoon that had just entered the public domain. The project became a blend of nostalgia, experimentation, and irony, offering an opportunity to explore creative editing and graphics techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post provides a behind-the-scenes look at the project’s creation, from its conceptualization to its execution, and reflects on the lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept and Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Steamboat Willie as the foundation was a strategic choice. The cartoon’s entry into the public domain allowed for creative freedom, while Walt Disney’s controversial legacy and the Disney Corporation’s history of intellectual property disputes added layers of commentary and parody. The project aimed to reimagine the classic cartoon with modern techniques, blending humor and deeper thematic elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of &lt;em&gt;Steamboat Willie&lt;/em&gt; was a labor-intensive process that involved several stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial (failed) Attempts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Early versions of the project involved straightforward edits of the original cartoon. However, this approach proved time-consuming and unsustainable. To streamline the process, the project was divided into smaller, episodic segments, which could be released incrementally on social media and later stitched together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotoscoping and Colorization&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Rotoscoping—tracing each character frame by frame—and colorization formed the bulk of the work. Retaining the original character lines was essential to preserve the charm of the classic animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compositing and Backgrounds&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
New backgrounds were created or modified to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio, as the original 5:4 frames were too small. Some scenes required “outpainting” to fill in extended areas. Stock footage from a recent trip to Alaska was used extensively to create these backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Integration&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
The underwater sequences featuring Black Pete utilized AI-generated visuals. These scenes were intentionally surreal and artificial, serving as a meta-commentary on the idea of a “fake” world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color Correction and Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
To unify the disparate visual elements, extreme color grading across the entire project was used to ensure a consistent look and feel despite the varied sources of the footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound Design&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
Sound effects included squeaky toys, radio static, and a parakeet. Whale noises were used for the mermaid, and a boat horn replaced the cow’s original sound. The music was original, created using an MIDI keyboard and LMMS music studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://dndiy.org//posts/The-Melencholy-Adventures-of-Steamboat-Willie/Blender.png&quot; alt=&quot;View of boat in Blender compositing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes and Narrative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its heart, the video was about life, loss, and acceptance. The steamboat, named &lt;em&gt;Charon&lt;/em&gt; (after the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology), symbolized life’s journey. The river it traveled represented the passage of time, leading the characters—and, by extension, the audience—toward the inevitable end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the episodes, the characters grew increasingly detached from one another, reflecting the inevitability of separation and mortality. The emotional arc of the story was intended to evoke a sense of melancholy and introspection, contrasting sharply with the lighthearted expectations of the original cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges and Reflections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Shots&lt;/strong&gt;:   The concluding scenes proved particularly challenging. Initially, they lacked an engauging story and required extensive reworking, eventually being condensed for the final cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;: The sheer volume of labor involved in producing each episode made it clear that creating content of this scale solo was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience Reception&lt;/strong&gt;: While the project achieved moderate success (with an estimated 3,000 views across platforms - not bad, not viral), many viewers failed to pick up on the deeper themes and details embedded in the work. It highlighted the gap between creator intent and audience interpretation - something I see often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the technical aspects of the project, here’s a breakdown of the tools and locations used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filming Locations&lt;/strong&gt;: Portland, Oregon, and Kenai Fjords, Alaska.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom H4N audio recorder, Panasonic GH6 camera with a Zeiss Flektogon 35/2.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;: DaVinci Resolve (editing), Blender 3D (3D modeling), ComfyUI (AI generation), Audacity (audio editing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Arturia KeyLab digital keyboard and LMMS music studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m appreciative of the lessons learned. It was a project born out of curiosity, and a desire to create something meaningful. It is a reminder of why we should create—not for the views or the likes, but for the joy of bringing something into being that didn’t exist—but needs to exist. Despite its flaws, it has a place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of &lt;em&gt;The Melancholy adventures of Steamboat Willie&lt;/em&gt; - a fleeting, imperfect, exploration of life, art, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Remember me. I was.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the general hellscape of the internet, social media, and the world at large, I figured it was wise to teach myself html coding, make a time machine, travel to 1996 and bang out a sweet website in my mother&apos;s basement. The purpose is to create a central repository for my content, and own my data. There will be more features, updates, and posts to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is this Weirdo? What is this Place?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t worry this is a safe space! I will never ask for your home address and social security number.&lt;br /&gt;
Gregory Aster is a filmmaker, animator, and storyteller with a penchant for the bizarre, the experimental, and the deeply nostalgic. He spent 23 years as a mechanic - 10 as a certified technician and manager, then 13 as a business owner. Having retired from the trade, he now devotes all his time to creative media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His creative work blends cyberpunk, cosmic horror, and absurdist humor - drawing inspiration from old-school sci-fi, westerns, and the strange corners of pop culture. From dystopian fast-food conspiracies to interdimensional smugglers, his projects thrive on mystery, aesthetic weirdness, and an undercurrent of melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg has more than a decade of experience in local TV production, contract videography, and a lifetime of hands-on problem-solving. He is fluent in Blender3d, Davinci Resolve, can code a bit, works with ComfyUI, and experiments with cutting-edge video tools. When he&apos;s not crafting surreal narratives, he&apos;s either running around drinking too much coffee, beating on a machine with a hammer, or considering the deep philosophical and moral quandaries of science fiction, romance novels, and historical literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current and Upcoming Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m actively working on several projects, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mega Meal&lt;/strong&gt; - A dystopian cyberpunk cosmic horror series exploring themes of food, mystery, nostalgia, and loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Damn Website&lt;/strong&gt; - Whew! What a headache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housework and Furniture Building&lt;/strong&gt; - Life and duty calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Website Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Universe Theme&lt;/strong&gt; - This website is to include an alternate universe theme tied to a cosmic horror entity named Merkin (&lt;em&gt;In Progress&lt;/em&gt;). You may notice the absent dark/light mode switches that transport you to a parallel version of this space - a nod to my fascination with alternate realities and strange timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newsletter Sign-Up&lt;/strong&gt; - Sign up for my upcoming newsletter &lt;em&gt;that does not exist yet&lt;/em&gt; to stay updated on new projects, behind-the-scenes content - there is nothing exclusive about this - but if you want to stay in the know you now know you don&apos;t have that option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt; - Expect a mix of content here - project updates, reflections on creative life, inspiration behind stories, and occasional commentary on art and media. I would like to focus on community and listen to feedaback. so, I’d love to hear your thoughts on my work! Feel free to reach out with, ideas, or suggestions. This space is as much about community as it is about creativity. Speaking of community - if you want me to share and distribute your creative projects here - talk to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the works&lt;/strong&gt;  A newsletter section, more articles, art, a contact page, a resume, consolidated content. If you have any recommendations on website direction, or spot any issues with this space, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This website is where all of that comes together - a home for projects, ideas, and whatever else comes next. Stay tuned for more updates and sneak peeks as these projects evolve. If you want to collaborate, reach out! I never have enough time - but I can always make time for more - it’s a weird interdimensional nexus I exist in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and thanks for being awesome!&lt;br /&gt;
Greg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a shift in culture recently, and now AI is everywhere. We are talking about it constantly. It seems everywhere I turn, people are polarized and fired up about it. But truthfully, none of this matters. With new things, there is alaways turmoil. AI is no different - people are upset. People talk, torches and pitchforks are raised, fingers point, and accusations fly abound. I find all this really unfortunate and hope the turmoil dies down soon - but my heels are dug in, and I&apos;m ready for the long haul either way. This seems to be exaggerated by a generational divide, and this ia also nothing new. This argument is old - painters and cameras, horses and cars, practical effects and computer graphics. And whether for or against - we all use AI every day, constantly. We are swimming in AI - and at the same time, AI isn’t really what the hype says it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swimming in AI I refer to is our phones, map navigation, texting, media feeds, TV, ads, and more. There is no escape. We are drowning - and to survive in this sea of talking robots, you must understand how to use AI to be empowered and navigate the changing currents, and to understand this - you must understand that AI isn’t really AI. It’s just another tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s Deal with the Preconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is AI actually Artificial Intelligence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt; AI cannot think. If AI could think, then it would be real “AI.” What people generally call “AI” is just a branding term for statistical models called “neural networks” (which is another branding term in itself). These models can get extremely complex - so much so that it’s difficult to differentiate between AI-generated content and human-created work. Despite this, any “AI” generated work you see on the internet has a human behind it - because AI is not autonomus - it cannot think - anything it does is guided by human hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is AI art theft?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No, not inherently.&lt;/strong&gt; AI can’t steal any more than a paintbrush or a camera can. However, AI art, with its complex tools and abilities to mimic, can be used to steal and deceive. Just like any tool, it is possible be used for good and bad. The stories of theft make great headlines, so fear and anger have been misdirected at the machines rather than the people abusing them. The ones using AI to mimic and deceive are the problem - not the average user, and certainly not the technology itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Will AI take my job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes! If it hasn’t already taken your job, it probably will - or at least impact it severely. To understand this, we only need to look at history - I use the Industrial Revolution for analogy. Many people worked in factories then - these people became unemployed when a machine took their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do about the robots taking our jobs? Luddites tried to do something - famously, they destroyed the factory machines during the Industrial Revolution. They became symbolic of technological resistance and eventually got enshrined in language as someone incompetent with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With machines being able to produce art cheaply - and in some cases better and faster than the working artist - what do we do? The answer to this question is nothing new: control the machines that produce better and faster. Be on top of the wave rather than crushed underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does AI Affect Creative Expression and the Value of Art?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we stand out in this vast ocean of content? How can we keep up with the speed of its prodcution? How do we reconcile the seemingly pointless nature of creative expression? What is our value in a world where machines can generate art at the push of a button? The answer is art never had any value. It&apos;s all products, scarcity, and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re asking these questions in the first place, you are probably thinking more about capitalism and less about art. When you create something truly meaningful, it shouldn&apos;t be about the product or the scarcity of it - it should be about the expression and intent of what you are doing. You should be making something because you want to, because it is beautiful, because it deserves to exist. The medium it was made with should not matter. If you&apos;re produce because you want to commodify something, you are a producer. If you’re worried or upset that you can’t sell something, or that someone might devalue something that has no intrinsic scarcity - a thing that can be produced infinitely without effort - you can&apos;t really put a price tag on it. To desire to stop this flow, or to inflate its worth is a lie. People who produce only to sell let internalized capitalism govern their work, and they are slaves to a system that ironically treats them like a commodity themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the food replicator in Star Trek - did chefs cry and lament because they lost their jobs? In that utopian future, they didn’t. Cooking became a choice rather than a necessity. The real problem we face isn’t AI or automation - it’s capitalism. We’re thinking about art as a commodity, and we can’t commodify something that has no scarcity. The unfortunate side effect of this is that artists go hungry in a system that values only what is scarce, and digital media can be replicated infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of AI in art, scarcity can be less of a thing. You no longer have to be beautiful, you no longer have to cry and suffer for something - you can just, at the flick of a switch, make anything you want. We should really be making art not because we need more content in this world, but because we like art. Having no value attached to it is actually a boon. It allows someone to create without restriction. In the end, only individuals who rely on selling themselves or need other people for validation are the ones in danger of losing their power and prestige. If you determine that there’s something in this world that is missing for you - something that you want - whether it is a finished product or simply enjoying the act of creation - then make that thing. That is independence and power. The medium doesn’t matter. The medium is just a means, a tool. Tools will always change - but creation is timeless. True creators don’t get lost in the arms race - they simply make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can’t replace real creators because they define what creation is. The only thing AI does is challenge the tradition of production. The gulf between creators and producers is changing. If an artist chooses to use AI as a tool, it doesn’t make them any less of an artist. It simply means they’re using a different brush on their canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True art should be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is not a threat to the artist, but it is a threat to art as a product.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhapse we should stop, and consider reframing the conversation - its not about art - its about how we attach value to things, and ultimately people. Our values shouldn&apos;t be about our ability to produce. Somewhere in all this mess, our identies all became linked to our labor.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe without value attached - art can be free and accessible to people without means. If we restrict or cut out people who enjoy these things, you risk putting yourself on the wrong side of history. Look to the future - whether that future is liberating or dystopian depends entirely on who is moving forward. So, ride the wave, understand it. If you don’t like the medium - don’t judge someone who does. And if you want less AI - put down that phone, stop typing on a computer, don’t use a map. Instead, look around - get lost outside, talk to someone real, paint, dance, enjoy a sunset, and if you’re an artist, consider asking yourself questions - questions about why you do what you do, what your value really is, your personal expression, and what freedom to make whatever you want without restriction really means.&lt;/p&gt;
